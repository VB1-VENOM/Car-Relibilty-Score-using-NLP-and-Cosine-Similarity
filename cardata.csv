I can cart around my clients and all my signs/lockboxes/excess Realtor stuff. But its also very comfortable and safe feeling. Being able to sit up high is a plus when you drive 20k miles a year.

82493,112849,RAV4 SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl 5A)," I bought the 2012 V6 4x4 sport a couple of months ago. I got the sport because of the lack of the tire on the tailgate. I guess I was not paying enough attention on the test drive. This is the most bouncy jouncy bumpy car I have ever driven. every tiny bump/crack in the pavement is transferred right to your kidneys. I'm not sure if it's because of the sport suspension or the 18"" run flats. It is better on the freeway.The V6 is also a bit too powerful for this car, if such a thing can be possible.

When the time comes it will be hard to let go.  Warranty more than paid for itself. Keep critical elements maintained and the car drives itself. Namely timing belt/tensioner and oil changes. I don't have much sympathy for those who buy a German car and then are shocked when all they do is change the oil every 10k miles and expect nothing to go wrong. Go buy a Honda or Toyota and have fun driving around in your tin can!  It's a driver's car, therefore it does deserve some much needed attention.

She drove the  Mercedes SLK350 and CLK 350, and the VW beat both out in terms of utility and features. The back seat is really functional for grown-ups and purses and packages. The trunk is large with the top up and decent with the top down. It takes up little garage space. And, not even close to broken in, we got 32 mpg on the last tank!

The Two has all features I could ask for. There is obviously some initial adjustment if you've never driven a hybrid, but the fuel economy is as promised. There were complaints about lack of power but I drove a V6 before and had no problem adjusting. The car is a lot roomier than it appears, particularly the backseat. Headroom is great, and the trunk space is good as well. Of all the cheaper hybrids, this had the best features and room, and with a good deal it can cost you less than many non-hybrids.",4.75,2013.0,Toyota
72283,99274,Sonata Hybrid Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A)," My wife and I had been looking at sedans, not particularly hybrids. We had narrowed it down to Accord, Fusion, Subaru Legacy Sonata and Optima. We finally decided to drive them, and went to the Hyundia dealer to drive a Sonata Limited. I was most interested in the Limited with the Ultimate package because it had just about everything on it that the car I was trading in had. The car I was trading in was a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland. We did not want to give up the heated and ventilated seats and the Sonata with the Ultimate package had those. Plus the Sonata with the Ultimate package has all of the up to date safety tech. Most people don't realize that the Accord with Honda Sensing does not include Blind Spot Monitoring. I definitely wanted that feature. Anyway we where in talking to the sales person after driving the Sonata Limited and my wife was looking around the show room and came back with a brochure for a Sonata hybrid. So we started talking to the sales person about the hybrid and he insisted that we needed to drive one because the driving experience was different. To make a long story a little shorter, we loved the hybrid and wound up buying a sliver one.What I really like about the hybrid are a number of things; it is very comfortable to drive and ride in and it is very quiet. The safety tech is very nice especially the SCC (Smart Cruise Control), I find myself using that feature all of the time. I only have about 300 miles on the car and I'm already getting around 44 mpg in mainly suburban driving. It seems to have plenty of pickup, although with only 300 miles on it I haven't really put that to the test yet.

The car has all of the options that one would want in a subcompact.  The blue lit dashboard is easy on the eyes at night, and the sport shifter makes for slick easy shifts. The top shelf stock stereo works great.  Seating position is excellent, and power is on par with cars in this size and class.  So far, I've been able to beat EPA highway figures, and the engine is not broken in yet.  On that note, my primary gripe is the too short 5th gear.

I have even slept in the truck a couple of times, but don't try to climb behind the seats. My only regret with this truck is that i did not buy the 4x4. I would not use the 4x4 much, but it is nice to have when you need it. This truck in much bigger than the old Rangers.

The Italians know how to strike the right emotions when creating a car.

Even with those, I'm saddened by the fact that I won't be able to buy a re-design model as Mitsubishi has decided to cancel the car for now. Pros: would be affordable, AWD, Blutooth works flawless, heated seats with cloth (i hate leather), and great handling. The biggest cons are the fact that while the 2.4L will get you up to speed and stay there easily, it's dull to drive and slow to respond because of it's rubber band effect. The 2.4L with a shiftable auto would have made this car loads of fun. Also the CVT used to be extremely jerky. This was remedied by getting the transmission fluid flushed, but I wish I had known that initially because it was miserable at slow speeds the first few years. Anyone buying used should immediately have the fluid flushed on it. Also road noise is not reduced in the least. All that said though, this thing eats snow for breakfast, handles road trips like a wonder, and is the best value car i've found.

I feel like a kid in a way, I keep driving down dirt roads looking for a hill to climb over. Its actually pretty quite, unless going highspeed on x-way. You get a FJ Cruiser if you want easy.

I also installed a new modern sound system, since it had a base stereo in it. Now we have a way to play music directly from my Ipod.

Fuel efficiency dropped to 28 MPG. Then at 19,500 Mi. the transmission gave out entirely. Mazda Roadside was quick to response and the dealer has been excellent. Still, I've only had the car 2 yrs. and the entire transmission is now being replaced!? This was a $24K car. To say I'm very disappointed is an under statement.

I, also, get around 18 mpg in mixed driving (20 on highway trips), but this vehicle is made for off-roading so its suspension and drive train are beefy.  Handles snow great (4WD), but squirrelly in rain (2WD).  Very tough truck. My wife was in an accident, ended up going down an embankment, hitting a tree and bending the frame. Not hurt.

After trading in my 2010 S model for a new LE Plus, I could not be happier. The styling, ride, technology and interior room are greatly improved.

Good seating position in the front---rear seats are better than I thought they would be---actually tolerable for adults of average height for short rides.  Wish Ford would sell an accessory lockable gas plug for the truck. Alas, the huge annoyance with this truck is the auto-engine-off. Although Ford gives you an override button, deactivating the auto-engine-off is only good for one driving cycle, so you have to push it every time you get in the truck if you don´t want the engine shutting down every time you come to a stop.

107073,144007,500X SUV Lounge 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A)," I am 58 years old with a chronic pain condition. I was getting pain in my hip and back because my old car was not ergonomic and I had started a new job that gave me a longer commute. I'm  a very practical person so I've stuck with Hondas and Toyotas most of my life. I decided to look for a new car, and my top concern was a comfortable, power adjustable seat. I test drove Honda, Toyota, VW, and Chevy.  Just for yucks I thought I'd stop by the Fiat dealer, which I passed every day on my way home.   The 500 was adorable but uncomfortable for me. The salesman suggested I look at the 500x and when I test drove it, it was the most comfortable seat I ever tried.  I had such a bias in my mind against Fiat that I didn't bother to discuss numbers, and went my merry way to try more Hondas, Toyotas, etc.  I couldn't get it out of my mind how comfortable the Fiat was, and I loved the look so I went back for a 2nd test drive. Sure enough, still the most comfy seat I had tried.  Turned out to be right in my price range. I've had it 2 months and still love it. Back pain is much better.  Everybody comments on my car and says they love it. A couple of drawbacks, though. When weather and engine are cold, acceleration is very sluggish.  Solution is to use remote start while walking to car, and let it run a couple of minutes before driving, but that does cut into mpg. Also, auto transmission upshifts at 2000 RPM instead of 2500, and hovers around 1500.  Sometimes it feels like engine is lugging, though it has never stalled.  I can live with those issues, all things considered. I think Fiat markets to young people but they should think about marketing to seniors, as this car is extremely easy to get in and out of, is not too low or high.  So many of the Hondas, Toyotas, etc. are downright UGLY this year with huge black grills and weird angles that make them look like a monster.  It's nice to have a car that's stylish and meets my practical needs at the same time.  I thought I hated driving because of my back pain. Now I love to drive.

If the vehicle is still under warranty when the chains stretch, they will be replaced with completely different part numbers.If not under warranty you are screwed for about a $4-$5K repair.GM refuses to do a recall and there should be a class action pn this issue.

I have been retired since 1998 and had nothing but free time to sit in and check out all the competition (like Goldilocks) most were: too big or too small or underpowered or gas guzzlers or had too many whistles and flashing lights or too nuanced... THE SPORTAGE fit me and my plans just right.  I like driving the back roads and at 45 mph and get around 38 mpg in echo mode (on level ground... if its hilly not so much); observing about 24 mpg in and around town (but that's with echo off, riding normal mode)... I am headed to the blue ridge mountains and fully expect to be using sport mode and couldn't care less what the mileage will be for that because it will be fun (no white knuckle driving but there will be no Miss Daisy along for the ride).  Plenty of room for me and my stuff (and then some).  The Sportage looks great be it parked or on the move... oh you can tell it might be top heavy (knowing how gravity works) but if you drive it like you own it (responsibly) there should be no surprises.  I am really impressed with the different modes (echo, normal and sport), there is a remarkable difference in horsepower on demand between echo and sport... they make normal seem obsolete... but everything has its place, I suppose.",5.0,2017.0,Kia

The original owner replaced the Yoko 390's with Michelin XSE MXV4's as they wore out too soon. The ride is not super quiet over interstate pavement joints which may be exasperated by these new tires. I don't know. Also, the AC is so powerful that even in a Gulf Coast summer the fan speed on ""Auto"" has to be manually moderated. This involves using the Navigation touch screen.

It is very nice to drive and has great acceleration.  I commute to work and this car can get you out of trouble if you have to pass someone.

63073,87278,A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Premium 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM)," This is my first Audi and first plugin. While there are some things that aren't perfect (I'm looking at you radio/climate system), overall this is a very pleasing car.Who buys this thing? Gas is cheap at the time of this review, so you don't buy an Audi plugin to save money, exactly. Who buys it then is someone who likes the handling and style of the Audi and is willing to pay a bit more for it, but still wants to do the environment a good turn. I doubt they'll sell a lot of these.Still, for me, this car fit the bill. And I'm overall quite pleased. I've had it 2 months and still have over half the original tank of gas in it. I'm averaging around 270 MPG. I do that by managing how I drive and making sure to arrange things to drive on electric as much as I can. This clearly is not something everyone will want to do. For shorter trips and my daily commute, I run all EV. For longer trips, I put it into hybrid mode from the start and let the car decide when to use the battery. Performance: hate to disappoint performance enthusiasts, but I've never floored the car. I bought it for a reason and I stick to that. I have hit it harder in EV mode when I pulled out and misjudged the distance of the car coming. It went to around 60% and I was frankly shocked at the acceleration. This is because when you're driving it 'normally,' it seems to be tuned so that it feels weak. But noooooo, noooo, it's not weak. Cornering-wise, this thing is beyond awesome, but that's coming from a guy who has driven non-Audis before. Hey, it helps my MPG to go around corners without braking, right?I have two main complaints, mainly with the controls. Why can't I switch radio stations without taking my eyes off the road? Seriously, there are like 18 radio controls and they all require me to look at one of two LCD displays. Sorry, but I miss being able to hit button #3 and know that I'll get a certain station. They un-invented that. Second, there seems to be no way to just let clean air vent into the car in the winter. For a plugin, this does make a difference. Using the heater costs me miles. When it's not THAT cold out, I'd rather just vent rather than have a choice between a) fogged windows and b) use my battery to get the vent temp up.If you're looking for a racecar, why are you even reading this? if you're looking for the best plugin hybrid, you should probably go see a Volt. But if you are looking for a way to do a good turn for the environment, to do it in style, and to have some pep when you want to let it loose, this car is worth a look. Is it a good value? Depends. Mine cost around $35K after the Fed rebate. This puts in territory of normal small luxury cars and normal plugin hybrids. I'm not sure I'm 'saving' money exactly with this car, but I am pleased I bought it.Update after a year and a half of ownership: I don't have anything major to change and still think it's a 4 star car. I found that by pulling some tricks and putting in some effort I can boost the mileage I get on electric. But that begs the question: why do I have to work harder to get the most out of my Audi? The reason, as far as I can tell, is that Audi sits in a performance mindset, and for them the electric motor is a way to boost performance, with mileage an afterthought. I mean, car has a sports mode that is easily accessible, but no eco mode at all. That's the main gripe, but overall it's a very versatile and economical car.",4.0,2016.0,Audi

I just replaced the original tires at 30,000 miles, had an alignment done, and it runs like it is new again.  I agree with other posts that it tends to eat an unusual amount of turn signal lights, which is a minor annoyance because it takes time to replace them.

Interior fit an finish is excellent really like the leather seating and suede headliner, Black interior, Harmon Kardon sound, LOTS of bump.

Software update or flash update for my remote start and key fob. 3. New rotors and pads covered under WARRANTY, had to pay labour. 4. There was also another software update. Everything is running very well with my 2014 GC, I've heard there's another recall for the shifter which I haven't received any thing as of yet. At the same time I'm not sure if 2014's are apart of that recall,  I've just heard it the 2015-16 models,  but I will be going g into my local dealership to inquire.

Real world driving does not require seats that pinch your legs and shoulder blades to the point of pain. Red lights on the dash at night may be cool in a fighter jet but if you've become far sighted you will not be able to focus on them. Don't expect to carry any hanging clothes because the hook is too close to the drivers seat and the air bag won't work if you hang things on the grab handle.

It broke down twice, both times due to the alternator. The second breakdown was because an old alternator had been used to replace the first one and based on what I've read reliability doesn't seem to be a common problem with this car. Other than that I really enjoyed the car; the V6 had adequate power, although I would recommend the V8. I found that careful driving could get about 20mpg out of the automatic V6; I'm sure a manual could be fairly economical.

This is my first BMW and I must say I love this car.The car has an excellent combination of a comfortable ride and good handling.  The handling is not as sharp as the older style BMW 3 series, but its good for driving around town and maybe taking a corner or two at higher speeds.  The snow traction with the AWD is awesome.The Navigation system is the best I have ever seen.  Everything makes perfect sense and it works extremely well.  I love the fact that I can write letters with my fingers on the touch pad and it recognized them.  The navigation interface is the best of any cars I have owned by far.The Bluetooth menu takes a little getting used to but once you get used to it, it is easy to use.  It locks to my Android phone very quickly and phone conversations are clear via Bluetooth. Put the car in Eco mode and it is a pussycat just minding its own business and getting you from point A to point B in style.  Switch it to Sport mode and the car turns into a little monster pinning you back into your seat as you step on the accelerator.I have the premium package with Navigation and the winter package.  My kids love the heated rear seats in NE winter.The interior of this car is in need of an update to keep up with the new Audi and Mercedes interior.  But it is perfectly functional and looks good.  I wish that the climate control would remember the last fan settings and would not always start in the same mode.  I have to change the fan setting every time I turn the engine on.  The mileage for around town driving is in the low 20s, but highway is above 30 in Eco mode and if you keep your speeds around 60 MPH.  It is hard to drive 60 MPH on the highway with this car though as it is so smooth and quiet even at 90 MPH.I have not had a single mechanical or electrical problem with the car that required repairs.  It is under bumper to bumper warranty for 4 years of 40K miles.  It also includes free maintenance in that duration.  The Audi only provides free maintenance for 1 yr or 10K miles.I have owned Hondas and Toyotas prior to this BMW.  All in all, this is by far the best car I have ever owned and I would highly recommend it to others.  I am a life time customer of BMW now.",5.0,2014.0,BMW

Update: just turned 36k miles and still love our super wagon especially after our second child.  Zero issues other than the stock tires where crap. By 20k miles they where super loud on the highway.  Other than that only maintenance has been oil changes and other normal maintenance.*42k update - zero issues other than the plastic in the back is knicked up and scratches easy.  Other than that it's just been usually oil changes, on our second set of tires.  Went with contental DWS tires and it helped reduce the cabin noise a lot!  This is considered the best car purchase we've made.*50k update - still no issues other then a recall on the hatch lifts.  taken care of free of charge.  I will say as the kids are getting older, I really wish it was a quieter ride on the highways.  we bought portable dvd players to go over the head rest and we have to crank them to max volume for the kids to hear them.  Still can't complain considering the price and it's the only super wagon with a manual transmission and sliding passenger doors!*56k update - oh Mazda and your cheap paint, the front of the car from trips is getting pretty chipped up and my lack of keeping the bug guts clean off the front of it during the first few years has really shown it's mark.  So technically if I had kept up with cleaning the front of the car off during and after trips i'm sure the car would be much better off.

55869,78839,Accord Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 10A)," I researched everything before buying the Accord. Audi, BMW, Lexus, Toyota, Mazda, Nissa, Hyundai, you name it. After months of researching and test driving, I purchased a 2018 Accord Touring. Let’s talk about asthetics: The Platinum White with the black tires, badging, and underbody spoiler gives this car an aggressive look that turns a lot of heads. The look of the new model has really grown on me. At first, I didn’t know what to think, but it’s kind of like a new album from a band you love that has a different sound...sometimes you just have to listen to it for awhile before you can fully appreciate it. Getting into your Accord feels like getting into a spaceship. The back seats can fit your friend who is 6’4” no problem. The interior is well-designed and beautiful to look at. It is simple and elegant. The full digital readout and infotainment screen greet you when you turn on the vehicle - and I know you’re thinking the engine can’t sound good because it’s a 4 cylinder, but you’re wrong. There is a throaty growl when you turn on the car and even more so when you are in sport mode and testing the acceleration. The 10speed automatic shifts like a a dream and there are not many cars (if any) in the sedan class that can beat this Accord off the line. The heads up display and adaptive cruise control make driving less work - and the car can almost steer itself if you turn on the lane keep control. I bought this car with all the bells and whistles - if you could add it on, I did. Door sill illumination, puddle lights, spoilers, etc. All things that are completely unnecessary and this reflected in the bottom line I paid. However, I’m 29, so having a car that you could easily put a family in is important to me, but when I’m driving by myself I want something fun and sporty to drive. I have about 1,000 miles into it at this point. I’m sure that some bugs/issues will come up at some point, but knowing Honda we will get them resolved. I highly reccomend this vehicle.

73715,100782,Santa Fe SUV SE 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 5A)," I have been the owner of my 2009 Santa Fe all wheel drive 6 cylinder for approx. 3yrs and I bought it with 38,000 miles. I drive at least 85 miles per day.  First: the 09 Santa Fe drives terrible on the highway. It vibrates terribly and upon bring to dealer they said it was possibly tires or rotation was needed. (I put brand new tires on the vehicle at 45K and at 53k & rotate every year) this never fixed the vibration or the poor handling. Dealership told me I guess that's how it drives and there is nothing they can do. Second: my 09 Santa Fe has a horrible sound system that you can't put up over 14 decibels without blowing a speaker. The volume goes well up to 50. All of the speakers have either blown or went out which I have replaced three times with factory speakers and again they are blown. I have a three year old in the car constant so it's not like I'm blaring rap music with the bass at 10+. Horribly annoying and expensive to fix and not covered.Third & most disturbing: my 09 Santa Fe'a gas gauge malfunctioned at 61,000 miles. After filling my gas tank to a range full line I noticed I drove the car to just above a half tank. After turning car back on the gas gauge needle was buried at empty and gas light on. Very nervous immieditely went to get gas. Only took 18$ to fill. Strange which means it's not empty. Thought was a fluke. Drove to work used 1/4 of tank. Turns car back on after work. Read empty again. After filling the car yet again now using only 8$ I knew there was a issue. I brought to dealer they told me it is electrical. Fully serviced the vehicle through Hyundai.  At the tune of $184.00. Two days later. Started again. After reading on forums this is a severe issue and souls have a recall. It's the tank sensor. Brought back to dealer. They told me to remove old sensors and put new ones it will cost roughly between 500-1000 dollars. It is not covered under warranty and there is no recall. So much for 100K bumper to bumper warranty. This is a severe issue that can cause death or harm. If you don't make sure to reset your miles and keep an eye on your mileage you can run out of gas. The car may even just shut down at high speeds. I would not advise anyone to buy this suv I'm a former Jeep owner and as soon as I get the money to fix the gauge issue I will be selling ASAP and buying either a new jeep or Subaru. The gas mileage is terrible the car vibrates and you don't know if you have gas. Sounds like a death trap to me. Hyundai is putting people at risk with the above issue and should recall the vehicle to fix for free. DO NOT BUY!! Any Sante fa prior to 2011. They all have the same issue",2.0,2009.0,Hyundai

I sat in an orange car that I later learned was a Challenger.I've owned a lot of cars over the years, including a new 1997 Trans AM WS-6, which is a beautiful car until you have to do any engine work. I can say the Challenger is arguably the best new car I've ever owned.It is huge, it's larger and weighs as much as my truck, a 1st gen 5.9L Durango, yet it gets almost 24 MPG on the Interstate. It has many bells & whistles never thought of in 1970, and it's the best looking retro muscle car in my opinion.

Yeah, I don't run the a/c during the summertime (too hard on the engine ~ sounds like the entire engine is going to fall out), and automatic car washes cause water to get in the tail lights (horrible engineering design).

No DRLs, mileage is 18-19 mpg in city, but great acceleration and brakes.  Watch out when folding up/down 2nd row seats , seatbelt buckle can hinder seat movement to lock in seating position, found out the hard way and mashed the buckle mechanism not knowing it was the problem.  Overall very pleased so far, last van was  2004 Odyssey.3-month follow-up:Follow-up after 3 months - still very impressed with Sedona especially after replacing tires with Bridgestone equivalents (from Costco), now quiet ride.  Transported two twin beds (mattress, box, headboards and rails) all in one trip after moving middle row seats all the way up.  Noticed brakes were not as solid as I braked one time hard with seven passengers onboard and the van didn't quite stop as quick as I wanted as the brakes faded, no harm, but need to have dealer check it out.  All in all, still impressed and pleased with my purchase, will see what my first check-up experience will be with the dealership is like at 30K service.18-month followup:Still enjoying the Kia - no problems to report.  I checked the brakes at the 30K service, dealership said no problems on brakes, but I know that they fade when I brake hard with full van of my 5-6 kids due to weight?

191783,263225,S-10 Regular Cab 2dr Regular Cab SB," I bought this truck about 10 years ago.  It has been a lifesaver.  Four years ago on a crowded super fast highway that ran through town some maniac going 90+ tried to run my truck and a small SUV off the road.  The two of us sideswiped each other and the perpetrator got away BUT my little truck did not spin out of control or tip over.  It could have.  Both vehicles and all occupants were safe and sound and all I got was a 4-inch dent and a lost side mirror (replaced that).  The flexibility of this truck has been phenomenal. I plan on (when the time comes) to simply put a new engine in it.  But so far, no need.  Two weeks ago I easily (for me) replaced the pulse switch board for the wiper blades but that in essence was all.  It is good on oil.  I take care of it; give it regular maintenance check ups.  No major issues.  Yes, did have an alternator fail a month ago but the original alternator was already 17 years old.  The paint job has held up too.  I did have some AC issues that were handled by two different mechanics but given how heavily I use that part, totally understandable.  This truck has been a workhorse in every sense of the word.  It is my main commuting truck now and I used to use it for my job which required 30-40K miles of driving annually.  It is a stick shift and for that reason I can scoot out of the way when I need to. One update: windshield wipers kept dying on me so I researched it on You Tube and got a 21.00 part and replaced it myself.  All good now.",5.0,1999.0,Chevrolet

Also, the rubber material on the handle of the driver and passenger door has melted off from the heat (granted, I live in southern Georgia) and the plastic around the gear shift is ripping. I'm guessing the material just isn't high quality. The car has also given us a few scares on road trips when it starts shutting itself down, and the repairs have been expensive for that.

The 2017 Sport 2.0T lacks some of the Limited 2.0T features including the automatic rear view mirror, blind spot warning, push button start, moon roof, and ventilated AC seats.  I really don't miss most of these options but it is frustrating that the 2017 Sport 2.0T lacking the features of the 2014 Limited 2.0T is actually priced about the same as the 2014! I have also noticed that the 2017 is noisy and the turbo lags more than my 2014. On the other hand, the 2017 Sport Turbo 2.0 handles better and the steering is more resistant that the 2014, probably because the 2017 is sport tuned and the 2017 supports Apple CarPlay which is a big plus for me! (No need for buying the expensive navigation system.)  One thing that may be a issue for some drivers is that the steering resistance cannot be altered as it could be in the 2014.

You can still scare yourself silly if that's your goal. This car eats miles like no other I've been in including a friend's 911 GT3  and a 1964 Shelby FIA 289 Cobra (mine). This car cruises at 90 like the average car at 60 mph. The ride and the grip are amazing and the wind and road noise is low at speed. The exhaust note is wonderful especially with top down. You can drive a 600 mile day and not feel beat-up at the end. The quality of materials and the hand-craftsmanship is the icing on this very yummy cake!

Needless to say I was extremely disappointed but bought another one because I got dealer to pay off old loan. I am keeping my fingers crossed, hoping we don't have engine problems this time around.  Although the dealer worked with me in the end, I had to really fight to get them to pay off my loan with the trade- in. It was especially difficult dealing with the salesperson who sold me the 2007 van. I had to negotiate with the sales manager instead because of the salesperson's unwillingness to pay off my loan and give me a good price on a new van. It was very disappointing since the 2010 is my 3rd Honda.",4.25,2010.0,Honda
109031,146813,TL Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 5A)," I bought my 2011 TL SH-AWD in March and absolutely love it. I waffled between the '11, an A6 and a Lexus and Acura won me back on value and previous experience. You just can't beat the overall value of this car -- the features, quality and price.I find it odd that many folks decided to buy a TL based on the updated 2012 styling. Granted, the 2011's styling isn't for everyone but it is distinctive, daring and unique. In black, my car looks stunning. The 2012's styling has completed gutted the car of any distinctive quality.

It is definitely a kick to drive and the gas mileage while somewhat exaggerated by chevy and the bogus trip computer that always estimates mileage 3-5 mpg higher than actual, is still quite good at 30 city, 38 highway.

My windshield wiper motor has seized twice (one in the middle of a torrential downpour while I was on the highway and most recently in a snowstorm). Both times the entire wiper motor and assembly has had to be replaced ($400 each time). The air condition system needed to be replaced after only one year. The locks don't work anymore so neither does the remote starter. You have to manually push down the lock on each door- the power door locks don't work from the key fob or from the drivers side door.

The Corolla has great gas mileage, we average between 32 and 35. Handles well and looks good. It is so small though. The door pockets are not large enough to put much in.  There needs to be a trunk release on the keypad. It would also be nice if the direction and temperature indicator was on the rearview mirror instead of the dash. The front drivers seat can be raised... it would be nice if the passenger seat raised as well. The map lights on the rearview mirror are nice.

I had gotten into a small car accident where the front end went up the SUV in front of me. My passenger and I and the other cars were all fine. However the Intrepid is toast.

The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV. I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like 'soccer mom' cars until the Q5. That's what made the difference. The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs 'cute'. One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip.  My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool. ,5.0,2009.0,Audi

Fit & finish of the car seems quite nice. The only noise leaks are through the underbody panels because of no insulation/padding. Last 3-5 tanks are in the 35mpg area and we live in & around some hilly terrain... was in the 32mpg area until we changed over to a full synthetic. Currently @ 3000 miles on the car.

46571,67524,3 Hatchback Touring 4dr Hatchback (2.5L 4cyl 6A)," After spending the past number of years driving large SUVs, I finally made the leap back into a smaller, sportier car. I’ve considered other smaller cars over the years, but none really piqued my interest for one reason or another. I wanted a driver’s car but wasn’t really wanting to pay a premium price.  I also wanted a practical car but didn’t want to sacrifice performance and pure fun. For me, the Mazda 3 is a perfect amalgamation of what I’ve been looking for. It’s sporty yet refined, small but not minute, and practical but not boring in the least. It handles way better than anything in it’s price range. The fuel efficiency rivals some hybrid cars. The interior is flawless. The seats envelope the driver perfectly and lend a feeling of mutual comfort and secure fit. For the price, the engine is quick enough. Sure, I’d rather be in the 250 HP range, but that would require a compromise in aesthetics or a price increase of at least $15k. At this point, I’m extremely pleased with my purchase. Do your own research on this car and compare it to others in its price range and above. For pure driving experience and design, you won’t find anything comparable. Highly recommended.

187555,256760,SX4 Hatchback Crossover 4dr Hatchback AWD (2.0L 4cyl 5M)," I bought her brand new and now she has 58,000. She is garage kept and has her regular maintenance. I've never had any major issues. I believe there were 2 or 3 recalls which the dealership fixed right up with no problems. One of the dash lights where there gas gauge is located died about 2 years after I got her but it wasn't worth the price to pay to have it fixed, I can see the gauge with no problem so that never became a real problem.  She is super fun to drive, so much so my husband likes to drive her on the weekends. She's zippy, easy to handle, small enough to fit just about anywhere but yet it's roomy enough to fit a bike in the back with the back seats down. The AWD is great, we live in Central Florida and get lots of rain and I've always felt safe. My teenage daughters learned to drive in my car and have always felt comfortable. If I could I would buy a newer model but for now I will stick with my lil baby. When I see her in the parking lot I still think she looks so cute, sporty and fun. Mine is pearl white and has tinted windows which makes it look really sharp. When I see others without the tint I think it looks unfinished for some reason.Now the cons on her are all cosmetic. I still have the factory stereo which sounds great but there isn't a USB or Aux input for my iphone so I had to purchase a compatible plug which wasn't a problem. I'm sure I'll probably put a bluetooth stereo in soon. The other con is no front arm rest, so I purchased one online that sits in the middle holder and has a compartment. Also it seats 5 but the back seat isn't really comfortable for 3 adults. I got lucky and had 3 children but they did always complain it was uncomfortable and the headrests had to be raised up which was bad from me as the driver because I had a hard time seeing out the back window.I love this car and will love her til she gives out on me which hopefully won't be for a long time.**UPDATE: 6-13-17 I still own my car but my 18 year old daughter drives it about 90% of the time. She loves it and has decided that instead of her purchasing a new vehicle she would like to buy mine and for me get a new car. Only reason I would give it up is because I feel it's a safe, reliable, well maintained car for her and she's very comfortable in it to drive to college. She's 5'4"" about 135lbs and she says it's the perfect fit for her. We did put an aftermarket bluetooth stereo so that was a big bonus for her.***OH Knock on Wood!!!

I hit curve so hard that it almost took my life. I will never trust BMW traction control system again. If you own this vehicle and you live in a area where it rains a lot, I suggest you sell your BMW right a way. Its not worth it to risk your life for some beautiful interior designs.",1.0,2016.0,BMW

The car is stunning. It looks like a much higher end model than the rest of the C-class. I get people stopping me all the time. It is also the most comfortable highway car I have ever been in. The ride is dialed in perfectly for highway commuting, it gobbles up miles by the hundreds in quiet, ease, and refinement. It is not without it's problems however. I have had many interior quality problems, a persistently squealing brake problem, and frankly, it's not all that sporty to drive.

175948,241453,Charger Sedan R/T 4dr Sedan AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A)," My wife asked about getting a Charger, and I knew owners loved them but I was surprised to see that reliability complaints were few and far between.  So I agreed to look at one and I am so glad that we did!  After 18 months the car now has 18K trouble free miles with two repairs: 1) the sunroof lost its mind after about a year - it refused to work until it was reset and reprogrammed by a dealer and 2) it came with a cracked panel in the trunk that was replaced by the dealer.We purchased the AWD version because I personally would not consider a RWD car (which most Chargers are) in Chicago where we live.  AWD works great in snow and we feel very secure driving it in the worst weather.  It switches into AWD when the temp goes below the upper 30s and the mileage drops in the winter - we get 2-3 mpg less in the winter vs summer.  I do wish it had a switch to disable AWD but it does not.The AWD R/T has a softer suspension and different tires than the standard R/T.  We like it this way because it is a family car for us and everyone is comfortable in the car.  AWD also makes ""burnouts"" pretty much impossible, but if you are looking for acceleration there is no substitute for four wheels putting Hemi power on the road!  The car is really fun and comfortable to drive in any weather.Last comment:  2014 was the final year for the AWD Hemi R/T so 2014 is the year to get if you want this model.",4.0,2014.0,Dodge

The LS1 and 6 speed work perfectly together, getting 18mpg in the city and around 32(!)mpg highway.  OEM brakes are fantastic.  My car currently has 100k tacked on and feels solid as a rock.

Ford quality is way up these last many years.  My base model with manual transmission has plenty of power and a nice tight suspension for a gas sipper.  2008 models have totally new exterior styling from the earlier Foci, and in my opinion are much better looking.

The designer cars didn't impress us. Seriously. It all came down to personal preference and what would work best for our family. We did narrow it down to the ES and Maxima, but the ES has really short head space. We are tall people. My hubby is over 6 ft. and I'm 5 ft. 7. And each time we test drove an ES, I kept thinking ""old man car"". Plus the breaking wasn't smooth and it was downright boring to drive and we were worried about the Toyota/Lexus recalls. We purchased a black 2012 Maxima with gray interior with red stitching and couldn't be happier. We got a great deal on a SV Premium Package with rear spoiler. With its ample headspace, heated steering wheel, heated and air conditioned seats, Bose stereo, nav system, and double moon roof, we got all the perks we wanted and then some. It's a good-looking car that's a blast to drive. Looks and drives like a sports car. The manufacturer recommends premium gas, but the dealership said we could use regular with no problem.

99357,133784,Crosstrek SUV 2.0i Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl CVT)," I went from 2015 Crosstrek CVT to the 2018 Premium CVT. I went to the Premium as I liked the cloth interior and wheel style better than on the Limited.  Overall the car feels much better. Rides better. Much quieter and better breaks. Interior finish is also superior to the prior series. Basic stereo is also much better sound quality and Apple Car Play is HUGE! Still needs a bit more horsepower. The added torque is a plus but it could really use another 10-20 ponies. Now from going to the Limited to the Premium - you suffer in the digital readouts. The ODO and MPH gauges are red which is very cool but then they stick this super bland rudimentary and hard to read bright white gas gauge in the middle. Sorry, they whiffed on that basic readout and design. At night, the brightness and the style does not complement the other round gauges and I find this distracting. Stereo - I'll need to take it in as I get a lot of static when listening to regular radio. The biggest issue - major oversteer/understeer balance. Handling feel is nice but the oversteer/understeer balance was much better in the prior car. I know the car is now on the same platform of the BRZ which helps the feel and I am going to talk to the dealer about it. I'm sure nothing will come of it but worth a shot. I most likely will keep this for the long haul and will address the handling. Bottom line - overall I do like this series better than the other.

24803,35681,i3 Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Range Extender (electric DD)," I hesitantly sold my Mercedes CL600 and decided to lease the i3 REx to replace it.  I am not a tree hugger but I am a technology geek and the i3 has some fantastic technology built in.  My first impression of the i3 was that this is one ugly car and I did not like the look of the pizza cutter tires.  However, after driving it for several weeks, not only have the looks grown on me (as well as the 20 inch skinny tires), but i find it the car extremely enjoyable to drive.  In fact, it is so enjoyable that my wife prefers the drive to her Range Rover Sport and is constantly asking me to leave it at home so she can drive it.  The off-the-line acceleration is fantastic, which has helped alleviate the sorrow of losing my V12 gasoline engine.  The interior room for the front occupants is extremely roomy (I am 6'1"" with a large frame).  For a sub-compact car, this feels roomier than most other much larger cars.  The user interface took a while to learn, but now that I am familiar with it, I am very impressed.  The entertainment options are endless, especially when I connect my iPhone and use all of the music, streaming and pod cast services.  I use the car primarily to commute to work, 36 miles round trip.  I am also able to charge the car at work.  For commuting, the car is ideal.  I do have the range extender, but I have never actually used it as I have good charging options between work and home but it does take range anxiety out of the equation.  If I had to pick anything that I don't like, it is the placement of the electrical charging port, which is located on the back, passenger side of the car.  This requires me to get the charging cable and walk around to the other side.  While this is clearly a first-world problem, it would have been much easier to locate the charging port close to the driver's door.  The materials inside are excellent and I especially like the wood in the dash.  I leased the vehicle because I am not yet comfortable with the residual value of an EV, but given the subsidies available, and the fact that I no longer buy gasoline, this is a very economical vehicle to operate.    Overall, I was just looking for a very different car experience from buying another internal combustion car.  The experience so far is highly recommended.",4.0,2015.0,BMW

Thus, was looking for an SUV not for cargo space or off-roading, but for the ride and seat height.  With sports package, it is a blast to drive, especially considering its height and weight. It corners better than my '06 TL, though some of it is due to the massive 20"" 315 tires on the X6. Suspension is on the firmer side, but supple enough, once again especially for an SUV.

I was thrilled with the fact that I could get such a nice car with a 6 speed manual transmission.  It was perfect for me and my family - easy to park, utilitarian and good to drive.  However, that changed last month when every light on my dash started flashing just before getting home, and the coolant overflowing in my driveway.  Thank God I have AAA to tow it to the dealer.  Three weeks later, my dealer tells me that it was the head gasket and that they replaced all the seals as well as the timing belt.  Since I have the extended warrantee, it didn't cost me any more than my deductible ($100).  Now I'm wondering how long it's going to be before the head gasket fails again.  I love this car but now I question its reliability.Update:After waiting over 5 weeks to get my car back I picked up my car and found it had a strange grinding noise coming from the left front wheel - the mechanic told me it was the brake rotor and turned it.  Okay- I left the dealership only to have the car break down in rush hour traffic on a very busy stretch of  road.  It was a harrowing experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.  Once the car was returned to the dealer it was clear to see that the mechanic wasn’t exactly sure what the problem was- though he was trying to figure it out.  I ended up getting rid of the car.  I asked the manager why they only replaced the lower half (short block) and didn’t replace the heads - he said Subaru corporate won’t allow that under the extended warranty.  My brand new Subaru Outback’s felt cheaper than my old one (the doors sound tinny when they shut) and the tech is glitchy / even the outside temp thermometer wouldn’t register the correct outside temperature) - so I didn’t want to trade mine in on a new Subaru.  I really liked my Subaru when it ran but I couldn’t get past the fact that 3 times it totally quit without warning despite diligent servicing.  I can’t recommend Subaru to anyone.

I've used mobil 1 in my car since the day I brought it home, literally and I've had no problems! It is fun to drive, the easiest 5 speed I swear, I just changed the brakes for the 1st time at 90k miles. (you don't use much with a stick).

I only needed to replace my 2 door Civic I had sold in preparation of my first child. Its perfect for what I need. You won't find a cheaper new car that is decently built. You sit up higher than most sedans too. I like that! Although its taking me some getting used to pulling into a parking space as you can't see where your front bumper ends.

29312,42571,ATS-V Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 6M)," This car can't be compared to a Camry or Accord, but rather a BMW M4 or Mercedes AMG C63 S.  When compared to those cars, they're all pretty even.  The Caddie has the nicest powerband with the twin-turbo.  The 8 speed automatic (GM 8L90) is borrowed from the 650hp Corvette Z-06, so in the application it's pretty bullet-proof and understressed.  It shifts every bit as quickly as Porsche's PDK.  It's a wonderful driver.  You really can't describe it, but rather you have to drive it to understand.  It feels as though it is on rails.  The interior quality is very high.  The Cadillac CUE has been updated and I don't mind it a bit.  It is a little slower to adjust fan speed or temp.  People have complained on the BMW fanboy site ""Bimmerpost"" that the instument panel looks out dated.  I think it's fine.  It has a totally cool, configurable HUD like an F-16 fighter that really makes the instrument panel unnecessary.  All 3 of these top-notch sports sedans have their own personalities and whichever you pick will get you a winner.  What I liked about the Caddie was that performance-wise or, really any measure, it is the equal of Europe's best. The Caddie gives up NOTHING in performance, comfort, of technology.  Numerous outings from Willow Springs to the Nurburgring have shown it at least equal to BMW and Mercedes best.  The Caddie has touring/sport/ track modes that adjust damping/shiting and other parameters that make it excel as a daily driver.  The back seat is pretty cramped--seriously.  Not for adults.  I didn't buy it for the back seat though.  All that should go into my back seat is a piece of soft luggage.  The Caddie is 10s of thousands of dollars less than the other two and is arguable better.  And finally, you can feel good about driving an American car.  I NEVER thought I would own a GM car.  It's a new company though.  the 2016 ATS-V, Camaro, CTS-V, and Corvette Z-06 are all world class cars at bargain prices.  No longer is driving one a compromise.  They are among the best.  I am more impressed with this car every time I drive it.  That engine and and automatic transmission are absolutely stunning.  The chassis is very stiff.  The feature list is high.  It's an amazing vehicle.  Other cars I considered were the CTS-V, the Corvette Z-06 (way too cramped for me), the Jaguar F-Type R, and the Porsche 911.

Wireless charging the cockpit (they missed it, even with all the technology), vents in the 3rd row (this is standard on all 3rd row vehicles.  this is a huge mistake.)  4.  Driver's key pad for vehicle entry (Ford may be the only company doing this).  5.  Sunglass holder (pretty simple option).   6.  Basic Tire Pressure monitoring system (they have some formula with the sensors to tell you if the tire pressure changes.  Just use a standard TPMS valve).  I'm happy with the car, but at this price point the car should have these basic features.  I would also have to agree with the comment about the run flats.

I made the mistake of leasing this car for three years. Mine is a 328xi with the M Sport, lighting, premium, driver assistance, technology, and heated front seats. The newest iDrive system has some neat features, but lacks the simplicity of the previous version. The base sound system is actually pretty good. The front seats are okay, but the headrests are uncomfortable at any position. The adjustable bolsters are not overly confining. The way the center console and doors are designed make for some very hard places for resting your knees. There is lots of hard plastics around the center console. The rear seat has much better legroom than my 5, but the sloping roof and small windows take away headroom. The seats are not very soft and fitting 3 in the back is a punishment. Visibility is awful in the back. It has large 19 inch wheels, but it rides adequately. The car is very noisy inside. Lots of road and engine noise come in. The noise makes it difficult to make phone calls, and the Bluetooth is temperamental. The engine is smooth, although at times it will pause, and suddenly lurch forward. It becomes quite nauseating. The engine is extremely unrefined at cold startup. I had the same issue with the 5. For 54K, this is unacceptable. The frameless doors sure look great, and make a solid thud when closed. But be careful, because there are sharp edges, and my mother cut her arm walking by an open front door. The standard panoramic moonroof is massive. It's probably my favorite thing about this car. The xenon headlights are worth the extra cost. My 528i was okay on gas, but this car is not as efficient. I think it's because the car is heavier. It is noticeably less fun than the regular 3. It corners better than my 5 did, but it lacks the solid feel and comfort that I have come to expect from BMW. I will be turning this car in early and considering a better car.",2.0,2015.0,BMW

GREAT mileage - have hit 47.7 on the highway with only me and no cargo in the car.  Great handling.  Good headroom.  Cons:  Poor rear visibility.  Headlights don't light up front side of car, so can't see into where you're turning until you've already turned.  Tires get flattened very easily - can't even count how many I've replaced.  And they are not cheap.  Around 80,000 car became very loud inside while highway driving.  have to yell to people in the backseat for them to hear.

55011,77588,Civic Coupe HX 2dr Coupe," Bought my car at 90k miles, sold at 115k after owning a couple years.  Never had a problem with it, sold it for $200 more than I bought it for.  Took it down the Alaska-Canadian Highway, no problem (though it is very small and the seats are not the most comfortable in the world).  Calculated out 47mpg on some of these road trip stretches.  I had the manual, and really liked the fine, smooth way it shifted.  It was a very fun, responsive, maneuverable little car.  I don't have kids, so the coupe was perfect for me and my dog.  I'm also in the shorter/smaller/younger range, so getting in and out was no problem.  That said, my husband with his back/hip problems disliked riding in it, and my 50 yo father climbed in and out of it once and said that was it for him, no more, my car was going to give him a hernia.  To be fair, if you park it at a curb, you'll actually be climbing UP out of it.  Also, it should be noted that it's not the best/steadiest on snow and ice (probably because of its short/narrow wheel base and light weight), though I drove it two winters in AK and never wound up in a snow bank.  If you want to zip from place to place and do so reliably and efficiently, I highly recommend this car.  Watch who you're buying it from, though.  Mine was all OEM, and I know most of them out there have been modified (unless that's what you're into).",5.0,1998.0,Honda

Particularly from 2nd-3rd, as well as down shifting on down hills when applying the brakes. Not at all the time, but enough to make you flinch, expecting it to lurch you forward in your seat. Didn't happen during test drive or I definitely would not have purchased. Took it to dealer, was told this was ""normal behavior"" for this transmission and handed a print out of internal service bulletin ststing the same. Note to Ford: If you get so many complaints about an issue there is an ISB created for it, perhaps your definition of ""normal behavior"" should be reevaluated. Cheap feel to materials on interior, especially the doors. When you press on the door to exit, it just feels like dry-rotted foam behind it.

I didn’t want to find myself in a vehicle I wasn’t happy with AGAIN. I like to have either AWD or 4WD, but all of the luxury items you would find in a BMW. I traded in a 2015 Ford Edge AWD loaded, for the Ford Explorer Sport. This was the best decision I have ever made! It’s a very attractive looking vehicle inside and out! It’s fast off the line, and you don’t feel like you are riding on the ground because it’s so low especially in the 4WD. The sync 3 is a huge upgrade and way faster than sync 2. The Sony media system, front and rear cameras are amazing. The heated/ cooled seats, and heated steering wheel is also AMAZING! It rides very very nice on the road. My ONLY complaint is the fuel mileage on the 3.5 eco boost turbo isn’t what I thought it would be. That is my ONLY complaint. The interior leather seats and power third row with auto lift gate options are a must. Just wave your foot under the lift gate and it opens as long as you have your key fab with you.

The interior is beautiful, the polished wood steering wheel feels amazing to control. The sound system is hot, the style is hot. If you're also looking at the Acura MDX, let me tell you what the differences are: MDX has more power, more towing capacity and more storage space. It isn't as luxurious, refined or reliable as the RX 330. So it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a hot SUV, take the RX 330. If you're looking for something to camp with or tow with, pick the Acura MDX.",4.75,2004.0,Lexus

After buying it, I learned to love  it, too!  I quickly realized that it had poor resale value, but that was after the fact.  But, after developing a network of those to depend upon in case of problems, I understood that in the 55,000 miles that I've owned this car, it hasn't let me down ONCE!!  I had to have the front axles replaced by a private mechanic, a wear and tear item and a radiator, again a wear and tear item.  Other than that, I've just had to follow the owner's manual and it's been a fabulous ownership experience...and I bought this car with 82,000 miles on it!!  On the road, there is nothing like it!  It handles superbly and securely!  It actually inspires confidence!  It's our 'road trip' vehicle because of the confidence that it inspires!  I am totally happy with my 2006 XC70, but I tend to shy away from the dealership because of their excessive repair costs.  Volvo should outlaw their dealership repair network because they are not consumer friendly AT ALL price-wise! That’s probably why these vehicles have such poor resale value.  I am disappointed in this vehicle's resale value, but that behooves me with buying my next Volvo!  As I learned from an old Army buddy of mine, “take care of your equipment and it'll take care of you!”  Can't say enough good about my XC!!  I would DEFINITELY buy another Volvo (used car) since I have my repair network in place....outside of the dealership!",5.0,2006.0,Volvo

It was in immaculate condition but it had 109k miles on it.  After signing the papers, I got in my ""new"" van and started it.

When I punch the gas to try to pass someone it always hesitates.  The engine revs up for a few seconds before it kicks in and goes.  Also, when I have the A/C on the belt is always chirping.

I started having hip pain due to the driver's seat relationship to the gas and break pedal. The break pedal needs to move 2"" to the right. The seat is uncomfortable and needs another 2-3"" of foam. I ended up getting a 2016 altima and the hip pain took almost two weeks to go away; the seats are so comfortable. What a difference. Yes the Malibu does drive incrementally better and has better steering feel, but it's not worth the passion and discomfort. I test drive over 20 cars trying to make sure I would not end up with the issue of the break pedal to seat ergonomic nightmare of the Malibu. It was between a used 5 series with the sports package seats (the base seats are not any better than those on the Malibu) or the Altima. For some reason I found that most new cars have moved the break pedal towards the left! Huge mistake.--------------  Make sure you take a 30 minute drive in it. the front drivers seat is uncomfortable. I went from a 2013 Altima to the 2016 Malibu and i miss my Altima's seats so much. these are next to the worst front seats I've ever experienced. almost as bad as the 1998 Geo Prizm.  what a mistake. i'm going to lose some money to get out of it before i even even make a payment for the car.  while the steering tilts and telescopes the seat location, steering location and brake pedal are not tying in to my body. i am 5'9"" 168lbs.  for 286 miles of driving and i still can not locate a seating position that is comfortable for me. the real reason is the bottom cushion which is too thin and points upwards for some reason at the edge, and they are too short.  it is almost like they went for good interior materials and design, but took the money from the seats.

If you want to ""enhance"" an already very powerful car even more you can have Renntech tune it for an additional 50 hp making the AMG version only necessary for strict race track duty.The downside of the fist year have been a few trips to the dealer; the wonderful sounding Burmester system died once, the air suspension suffered a broken sensor and finally the handsfree door handles also failed. The powertrain however has been bullet proof for 10k miles. European cars in general tend to have teething issues and this car has been no exception.

Outside of that the car is cool, also all of mercedeces cars during this time had trouble with fiberoptics, which were just being introduced.

It wasn't until we were stranded for 3 hours do to a transmission failure with 10,500 miles on the vehicle that we found out just how unreliable it would be. The Jeep was towed to a local Jeep dealer for repair. They provided excellent service by the way; five computer modules were upgraded and the problem appeared to be corrected. A day later, the problem reappeared, died while on a highway, and the vehicle went back to the shop. This time they determined that it would need a valve on the transmission that had failed. The unreliability of a vehicle with only 10,500 miles made me very nervous for the future. My wife and I were visiting Florida at the time and the thought of driving 1,400 miles to get home to upstate New York with a vehicle that could shut down any time during the trip prompted us to trade the vehicle immediately. To make matters worse, we lost half the value of the purchase price by trading a 9 month old vehicle, but felt that we had no choice!

If I wanted a beautiful but poor quality car I would have bought a Jaguar. 44000 mile update. I had to replace the A/C compressor and the plastic slot in the dash where I put my sunglasses has cracked in multiple places. The rubber stops for the trunk lid are disintegrating. Rust has showed up on the bottom of the passenger door around the rubber seal, which is really strange since the only time the car gets wet is when I wash it. Two hydraulic valves for the convertible top leaked fluid inside the car and had to be replaced as well as the stainless cables that hold tension on the top.

88530,119825,Camry Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A)," After driving this car for 15 months I have decided to express my opinion. This car is nice to drive, but a little rough riding. The interior is spacious and the trunk is nice and roomy. The four cylinder engine has great power and acceleration but it is hard to achieve the gas mileage that Toyota claims this car will get. The trip information computer can not compare to my GM vehicles which are more user friendly and offer better user information. ",3.375,2012.0,Toyota

I waited 7 years.I can tell you for certain that the Nissan Titan is one giant money pit. It will have problems and Nissan will not support you.  I will never own another Nissan.Power windows, stereo, brakes, and rotors will fail/warp and you will spend tons trying to fix these issues.  Not to mention the squeaks, whines and rattles that Nissan will not be able to pinpoint or fix.Driving this truck is akin to what it might be like to drive a freight train.  Or... driving a really nice looking freight train.  I only had 72,000 miles on it when I ditched it and I was going on my 4th set of tires.  Good tires.  Is this a problem?  Nope.  Not according to Nissan.  They say it's totally normal.  They say the truck is so powerful (it is) that it eats tires.  Truthfully- this truck has far more power than a Ford or Chevy fan would care to admit, but that doesn't make it worth owning.Don't buy a Titan.

Nissan fixed it the first time for me around 80,000 but wouldn't fix it the second time. So the next one I bought off the lot was a basic manual transmission, a 2012. I didn't have high hopes for it but this car is almost at 200,000 miles now and has not given me one single problem. I would never buy another CVT but the manual is fabulous.

Unfortunately to get the 2.4l engine after 2017, Honda only offers in the base model the LX. I would have loved to get the extra options offered in the EX model, but I absolutely refused to buy the turbo model until Honda fixes (poor climate heat/fuel-oil dilation). I think Honda only offering the 2.4l (tried and true) engine in the lower end base model is a big mistake.

It's normal wear and tear on a car that is 5 years old and has 68,000 miles. My mother's Chevy was stolen and wrecked and the driver's side door was smashed in, but amazingly the window still works!

No repair issues; one strut replaced under warranty ages ago, front brakes at 75K miles, and otherwise regular maint.

Fuel mileage is great for this engine and AWD. I've gotten a best of 32 MPG on the highway in the Winter, driving 120 km/hr. I imagine 35 MPG highway is attainable in the Summer.

It's fun to drive, especially with the manual, which is important to me. The city gas mileage isn't all that great, under 25 mpg, but I do a lot of start and stop driving in a hilly city, so that's to be expected I suppose -- but if you were maximizing for that you should get  a hybrid. Gas mileage on the highway is great though the tank is pretty small, so you do have to make stops on long road trips. Visibility is great which is key for urban driving with lots of pedestrians.

It clunks when shifting into gears from a stop, and is very notchy thru the upshifts. Ford says this is a normal action with the manuals, so beware when selecting a manual transmission. As expected the fuel economy is averageing 12mpg, with the 5.0 so don't complain about the lousy mileage.

The comfort, quality of ride on the interstate, quietness of the Atlas at interstate speed is as good or almost as good.  The Fender sound system is much better than the Bose I had in the Audi Q7.  More room and much easier to get in third row.  Easier to enter and exit the back seat (2nd row).   Factory towing of 5000 lbs was a plus and my travel trailer (3000 lbs) communicates with the car - turn signals and anti-theft warning.  You cannot use a load leveling hitch on any VW product but it pull the trailer as easy as the Audi Q7 did except for acceleration.  The Atlas does a good job but not as fast as the Audi.

And that's fair, because this car lacks the style, power, or luxury of those brands. Still, it does have style, power, and luxury, just in more modest amounts.My priorities that led me to buying this car were that I wanted something:~fairly luxurious, but not extravagant in cost~good MPG, and good reliability, to keep the cost-per-mile on my long commute low~modern tech, advanced featuresHaving owned it a year, I'd say it succeeded on the first two points, and failed on the 3rd. My car is indeed about as nice as you'd expect for $35k, it is indeed getting 32-38 mpg depending on the situation, and it is indeed a Honda with rock-solid reliability. I drive a 60 mile round trip daily, and the car does a great job of rolling along with a quiet ride, and a feeling of confidence that it won't break down (like my BMW used to do all the time!). It has a nice amount of pep, the 8 speed tranny can get a lot of power out of those ~206 horses.My complaints are mostly with the tech:~dual screens are confusing, and it's frustrating having to push several touch-screen options in a row to do things as simple as adjust the A/C fan speed.~VERY SLOW on-board computer. Inputting basic commands into the Nav or audio system is maddening. It's sort of a similar feeling to using a first-generation iPhone which is overloaded with too much software. The CPU is too weak to can't handle the demands put on it, so it can take as long as 10 seconds to even react to button presses. 10 seconds is the worst-case, most often it takes more like 1-2 whole seconds to respond, but that is pretty terrible in comparison to the .05 seconds most smartphones take these days. Attempting actions like scrolling the Nav map image often lead to the system nearly crashing, or getting stuck and scrolling way farther than you wanted.~cell phone integration is very weak. It can sync with Pandora on my phone, but it requires several confirmation screens each time you use it, so it's not really worth the trouble. Siri hands free is a joke, you may as well just push the button on your phone and use that instead. ~The tech package supposedly has high-end speakers, but I've found them to be very mediocre, and lacking in bass. The single 8"" open air ""subwoofer"" is not impressive.I'd agree with Edmunds overall rating of the car as a ""B."" That is to say, it's basically what you expect, a low end luxury car.

5946,8075,Touareg Diesel TDI Lux 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A)," Driving the amazing VW Touareg TDI is like no other driving experience I've ever had.  Prior to the Touareg, I drove Audi A6 bi-turbo and A4 for nearly 11 years.  Eventually, I decided that I wanted something that would allow me to enjoy the sporty ride of the Audi's, but give me capable off-roadability.  Well, I found this in spades with the VW Touareg. (Confession: I was so absorbed in the Audi universe, the Touareg was completely off my radar.)  When I decided to acquire an off-road capable SUV, I looked at all the usual suspects, but after driving Audi sport sedans for so long, nothing in the SUV market really grabbed me.  I did test drive the gorgeous Audi Q5, but found it too cramped inside.  I test drove the Q7 and although it was plenty spacious and a beautiful vehicle, it was just much more vehicle than I needed and didn't smack of the off-road prowess I was seeking.  At one point in my search for my next ride, I saw an Ad for a VW Touareg TDI turbo diesel. Hmmmmm . . . I thought to myself  - wondering what this is about?  So off to the VW dealer for a test drive.  My first impression was extremely positive as I checked out the exterior lines and the interior accoutrements.  So, pulling out of the dealer's lot and onto the highway, I'm pushed back into my very comfy seat as the turbo diesel with it 407 lb. feet of torque accelerates like my Audi A6 and instantly, I can sense a creation of huge smile sneaking-up on my face combined with thoughts of 'WTF', this thing is amazing!  The ride was incredibly quiet, smooth and planted. The torky TDI provides instant power delivery to the wheels with absolutely no hesitation or lag. The test drive route the sales person guided me through consisted of stop-and-go traffic, open highway and a section of twisty county road.  All I could think about is how slot-car like planted, precise and fun to drive the Touareg was. Serious Wow factor to be found here (Akin to a huge Audi A6). Later that day, I went on YouTube and reviewed the numerous videos of the Touareg performing off-road and I was sold!

55860,78830,Accord Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 10A)," Decent incentives right now, we were able to get ~$3k off MSRP.  Love all of the technology built into this car.  However, the biggest selling point for our family of four was interior room.  I did months of research on the new Accord and nothing in this class really comes close.  We downsized from a Honda Pilot so we were concerned about leg room and the loss of utility that came with having a SUV.  While I do miss the auto opening and closing hatch on the Pilot, the roominess and overall comfortable feeling in the interior works very well for us.  Almost seems like we have more interior room.  I am 6'4"" and can put the drivers seat all the way back and my 5' tall daughter still has plenty of leg/knee room.  Love Love Love the 10 speed auto and 2.0 turbo.  Never owned an Accord before so I can't compare my 2.0T to the previous V6 models.  However, the transmissions works quickly and smooth and the car is much quicker than I expected it to be.   My only complaint, and it is a small one, is I wish on the Touring trim Honda would have added the USB ports in the back console for the rear passengers.  You can buy it as a add on at the time of purchase but it is not cheap to have it installed, so we opted not to do it.  Should just be included.

The only parts needed replacement were alternator ($300) and an ABS relay ($25). All else are running flawlessly and my mileage is between 18-21 mpg (within specs). Can't be happier - I hope I can run this for another 5+yrs. Maintenance is simple: Flush all fluids (AT, PS, brake, differential, coolant) every 2 years - doesn't matter mileage or usage.

With 97,XXX and counting, I see a long future ahead for this one.  I plan to hold onto this truck for many years to come.... I purchased the truck with about 38,000 miles, and have not had any major issues to speak of. Other than regular maintenance (fluid changes, tune-up, belts, tires, batteries, etc...), and some minor upgrades (heavy duty shocks, CIA, exhaust, etc...) this truck never see's the shop. It's extremely responsive, has plenty of torque, and makes a great tow vehicle. That said, it's not the most comfortable truck I've owned, nor is the most agile.  Still it's a great truck and is probably the best vehicle purchase I've ever made (and I've owned a lot of vehicles), given the price I've paid, and the years of service I expect to get from it.",4.0,2004.0,Nissan

Average 18 mpg in mixed driving, but 40 hp more would help move it better. On the Autobahn the faster you drive the better it runs and it gets the same 17 mpg at 110 as 80 mph!  We keep the baby seat in the center, but it lacks the latch anchors so we have to stagger the two side seat anchoring points. Also, my biggest beef with the X5 is the factory running boards.  While making it sportier they get in the way getting in/out.  My poor wife gets dirty every time she puts the baby seat in.  Lastly, the driver's seat always ends up in the wrong spot even w/memory seats, a few flaws that get irritating!",4.375,2008.0,BMW

I just purchased a 2010 Jetta Sportwagen TDI to replace it, and I hope it is just as good.  I see concerns that VW repairs are expensive, but not really much more than anything else. Find a good local VW Mech, stay away from the dealership 4 repairs, $100 per hour labor can add up fast.

44266,65081,CX-9 SUV Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A)," First off, the value of this car is simply amazing! It is no wonder how it received the title of the SUV of the year this year. I smile the second I get in this thing and find reasons to drive it around. Before buying, I research vehicles a ton to find out what to buy and the best value for what I need. Nothing else was even on the radar after reseaching the CX-9 and after test driving one. If you have never driven a Mazda, I don't know if you can understand to zoom zoom theme and the quality of these vehicles. The CX-9 has plenty of power with the 3.7 V6 engine and handles like a much smaller car. The comfort from the leather heated seats is second to none and I have ridden in my fair share of comfy seats. I really don't think you will be disappointed in them at all. The cabin is made up of quality materials all the way around. Soft touch material almost everywhere (not on the dash) and you can tell Mazda thought things through as far as placement is concerned. The navigation system is a bit outdated now (in 2016), but is still functional and considering how fast we all know that technology changes, I think that is a feat in itself. Moving onto the sound system, I challenge someone to find a better sounding system than the Bose system installed in the CX-9. The base and treble is outstanding. I have had several people comment when riding in the vehicle about how good it all sounds. The proximity key system, push button start and power lift gate are great features that unless you have or have had them, you won't really know what you're missing. A standard key and keyless entry would be sufficient, but it is nice to have the options if you can get them. The interior space and sliding middle row is a great feature that makes increasing leg room to the second row or getting passengers into the third row much easier. You will love it or should I say your passengers will love it and thank you for it. Very nice. The storage space in the front for odds and ends is limited in my opinion. I don't have a plethora of things to store, but I found it to be tight and cluttered looking in the center counsel because of the things I had to store in there. Not very deep or wide, but great quality materials and padding are certainly present. The bluetooth phone connectivity is adequate. Displaying the names of callers and making an easier set up/pairing system would be great. It is a little tricky, but I did figure it out after some troubleshooting. Overall, I could not be happier with the purchase. I honestly rate driving it and owning it a 10/10.

The ride is extremely quiet and the gas mileage is great. I am actually surprised from other reviews that others are averaging less than advertised. From my calculations I am getting 48-49 mpg, but I do drive less aggressively than I used to and keep it on the ECO setting all of the time, so that could make a difference for some people.

65665,91054,A4 Sedan 3.0 quattro AWD 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6M)," I've had the 3.0 for about seven months and really enjoy driving it whenever I get the chance. I'm not overly impressed with the S4 this year as the cost/performance ratio is not that great.

If someone is looking for a car that's economical and can't afford a civic or a corolla this is the car with comparable features as the competitors. I wish Kia and Hyundai would hold their value much better. Overall it's been a great car and Korean have come up in the auto industry.  ",3.25,2002.0,Kia
73552,100610,Santa Fe SUV Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A)," My  2015 saved us during a massive accident. An 85 year old man had his second accident of the day by pulling across out multilane divided highway at just the wrong time. We hit him at something less than the 60 mph limit and both my wife and I walked away from out totaled Santa Fe. The airbags worked so well that I didn't even have bruise marks from my glasses. The only downside is that Hyundai, and everybody else, I suppose, puts the horn button on top of the steering wheel airbag. I wonder how many other people suffer my injury: my hand-on-the-horn got blown back into my chest. It took almost two months for the pain to fully subside, and another month for my hand to regain most of its strength.Tow rating was important to me. If you buy the PIO (port installed option) trailer hitch package, the Santa Fe Limited (and SE) have a 5000 lb tow rating. According to the owner's manual, even with an aftermarket hitch it is only rated for 2000 lbs. After the accident, even though the force of our connected travel trailer impact bent the ""stinger"" 90 degrees into the bumper, but the Hyundai hitch structure seemed undamaged. The impact was so severe that even the trailer was totaled.After the accident we had time to reflect on a replacement car. We felt so well protected by the car and had enjoyed all the features of the Ultimate package that we got the identical car in the 2016. Right away, both of us independently thought the 2016 was substantially quieter; I think they've added insulation and maybe fine tuned the suspension. I've seen a lot of negative comment about the third row seating. With the SE bench seat it might be a problem, but with the Limited's captains chairs it isn't much of a deal to get into the third row. Just for grins, my wife and I let our daughter and her 6' 5"" husband drive and we rode in the third row for a six hour day trip. Grandsons in the middle. We're both 70 y/o and it was perfectly comfortable. Having the panoramic sun roof almost reach the third row makes it much nicer.My biggest complaint is that Hyundai hasn't incorporated Apple's Carplay into the display system. The existing nav system is nice, but not as good as Google Maps or Apple Maps, plus I have to pay an annual $50 fee to Sirius just to get traffic information incorporated into the nav system. Carplay was supposed to begin showing up in another Hyundai model in 2015 so I figured the 2016 would definitely have it: Wrong! The BlueLink ""turn by turn guidance"", which is $100/ year is not compatible with the navigation system. Go figure.",5.0,2016.0,Hyundai

95073,128326,Spectra Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M)," I bought our 2007 Kia Spectra EX with only 4,000 miles on it. It is currently just shy of 170,000 miles and is still driving like a dream! I have never had any issues with this car, its been beyond dependable since I bought it 8 years ago. We have done regular maintenance (oil changes, tires, brakes, etc) the only thing we had to do was replace 1 front-end tie rod. This car is such a beast (in a very miniature package) that the factory brakes and rotors lasted 155,000 miles before they needed replacing. I was very skeptical about Kia when I was initially car shopping but couldn't beat the price and dependability. The car is overall comfortable, I am 5'5 and have more than enough room; however, I will admit that my 6'2 husband driving it does make it look a little bit like a clown car! My only complaints I have about this car is that it doesn't have cruise control and the front seats feel more like cinder blocks than the cushy seat facade it gives off! To sum it up: If you find a Kia Spectra, buy it! Its the best money you will spend...and now they are classics!2/18 Update: About to hit 190k miles and she is still going strong!",5.0,2007.0,Kia

It feels like a much more expensive car. It's fast, quiet, luxurious, head-turning - I could go on and on! I enjoy my drive to work so much now that I actually wish it were longer.I shopped this car against the similarly equipped Subaru Outback (ltd w/moonroof) for a long time, but I think that the value is much better on the Honda Crosstour - it really feels like a lot of car for the money.EX-L/4WD MSRP is about $35k, but I had two quotes for less than $30k.

Haven't had to touch anything under the hood.  Just the usual wheel bearings and tye rod replacements that you would normally have to with this kind of mileage.

45824,66735,6 Sedan s 4dr Sports Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M)," Compared to the Mazda MPV I used to drive, this is head and shoulders above that.  The acceleration wont win you LeMans, but it is more than sufficient for daily driving needs.  In order to get the side impact airbags that my parents so desperately desired, the purchase of the sports and entertainment package was necessary, including Bose sound system with in dash 6 CD changer mounted on and extremely sexy center panel, side skirts, moonroof, and spoiler.  The only problem I have had are flat tires, which are extremely expensive to replace.

Even my buddy's Porsche 911 (although powerful) doesn't generate the same feel as the Miata roadster. The Shinsen edition color got great reactions (some even asked what kind of car it was - Jaguar?) and there are tons of modifications one can do (under the hood) and styling.  I've kept mine pretty stock, but plan on adding turbo next year for some racing pep.

27416,39852,Escalade SUV 4dr SUV AWD (6.2L 8cyl 6A)," This Caddy (ESV) is an absolute dream. The sheer presence is impressive. Everyone that sees this thing loves it. When quickly accelerating the exhaust reminds of the race cars in ""Days of Thunder"". What a sound - almost better than my Vet. When you enter the car at night, the lighting, both inside and out, are unbelievable. Everything about this vehicle exudes luxury.  I have read some complaints about the trans. But, I like the way it works. It tends to quickly go to the next gear. You have to go nearly 80 MPH to get to 2K PRM - an amazing engine. Still, if you're in hurry, you just need to punch it and it takes off.  Like the TV ad says, if the Escalade had a bathroom, I'd live in it.",5.0,2008.0,Cadillac
87441,118696,Camry Sedan XLE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A)," I purchased the 2015 XLE V6 fully loaded with the technology package.  Lots of features to discuss.Performance:Acceleration is strong - this car has LOTS of get up and go!  The V6 will not let you down.  Just be sure to realize that when you're in the higher gears and drop the pedal, there will be a hesitation as the RPM increase in the engine is translated to the drive train.  Speaking of the drivetrain, shifting from gear to gear is very much a non-event - barely noticeable.  Dropping it into ""manual"" shift mode gives you some control over performance, but the car will still shift for you if you're exceeding limits.  Steering is softer than I'm used to (previous car was '02 Honda Accord).  The electric steering is very lightweight and allows some slop in handling, as a result road handling is lessened a bit.  Body sway is noticeable on highway entrance ramps.  Braking requires more pressure than the Accord.Comfort:All aspects are deemed ""OK.""  Front seats are stiff - not sure yet how they'll be on long road trips.  Back seat has plenty of legroom and supportive seating makes the ride comfortable.  Exterior noise is minimal, and for the first 1500 miles there have not been any noticeable vibrations (knock on wood).  Entering and exiting the car is easy as the doors swing wide open.  Careful review of the backseat entrance should be made by anyone with limited mobility.  Longer legs will need to be picked up before swinging them out in order to egress the vehicle.Interior:Instrumentation, controls, and design of the interior all get top marks. The car looks like a luxury car!  That having been said, the weak spot on this car is the storage.  Trunk size is sufficient, but interior storage is limited at best.  Coming from an Accord where there was literally storage everywhere you turn, the Camry is sorely lacking in this realm.  You get a panel console that doubles as a charging bay, the glove box is pretty much worthless for anything but the owners manuals, and the door storage bins will hold nothing bigger than a small umbrella.  The armrest console in the middle is nothing but one big bin.  In essence, if you have small cables (phone charging cables), small objects (I carry pens, chewing gum, and my daughter's hair accessories), or other items know that they'll end up in the big console without any sort of organization.  To find them while driving down the road is nearly impossible, so you either have to plan ahead or just wait until you hit a stop light.  As for the quality of materials, the leather used in the seating is fine, but the materials used for the ceiling panel is cheap.  The doors are part leather and part hard plastic.  Previous Toyota ownership shows that extreme care must be taken with the hard plastic as it scratches easily.  Those scratches are permanent and will not come out no matter what you do.  For a $30k+ car, I would think that Toyota could afford to finish the doors in leather and provide a better ceiling.  Safety:Luckily, I haven't had to test out the safety features yet, but from what I can see they will perform as expected.  The LED headlights are OUTSTANDING!  Vision at night, even rainy nights, is perfect.  The LED daytime running lights are bright enough to be seen in the sunniest of days, and on rainy nights help ward off the road glare of oncoming traffic.  As mentioned above, I have the technology package on my car which includes the blind spot monitor, lane departure warning, pre-collision alarm system, and adaptive cruise control.  The blind spot monitor and lane departure warning work perfectly, the later beeping softly when you get close to leaving the lane without a signal.  I have noticed that it will occasionally warn of lane departure when the road markings suddenly end.  The pre-collision does work.  If you're accelerating when the person ahead of you is braking, the car starts braking and the beeping starts.  Obviously, this is useful but it could be a real pain in the rear if you accelerate to change lanes when the car in front of you is slowing down.  I have only tried the ACC once and it seems to work well.Technology:The head unit is relatively intuitive to use.  Touch screens dominate the interaction between driver and unit.  Aside from AM/FM/CD Player options, the unit allows for satellite radio, Bluetooth input from cellphone/music player, USB flash memory, and ""Aux"" in options.  The Entune apps allow for use of cell phone data to play Pandora, IHeartRadio, Slacker Radio, as well as Facebook Places, OpenTable, and MovieTickets.  You can also check weather maps and forecasts, review sports scores, check your stocks, and locate the nearest or lowest price gas station.  Be aware that use of all of the Entune apps requires use of cell phone data so either have a large data package with your cell phone provider or limit your use of the Entune apps.
